            <h3>Joe Blogs</h3>
            <p>I sustained an injury to my ankle a few weeks before a major competition, I lost feeling in one half of my foot and my ankle was swollen.</p>
            <p>A day later I went to see Mobile Physio, this was the best decision I made. Their sports massage provided me with full mobility and the next day the swelling was gone.</p>
            <p>They taped my ankle and now I'm back ready to compete in the upcoming competition.</p>

            <p>During my preparation for a large sporting competition, I sustained an injury to my calf, so I went to Mobile Physio. They used deep-tissue massage and provided me with a detailed recovery plan.</p>
            <p>Their Injury Rehabilitation techniques help my calf heal and allowed me to compete in the competition, and win!</p>

            <p>I had noticed increasing pain in my lower back, when my GP recommended to see a physiotherapist. I visited Mobile Physio after being recommended by a friend, after they had seen great results in recovering from an injury. </p>
            <p>They have very friendly staff, that made me feel welcome and explained the recovery process to me. The physiotherapist was extremely knowledgeable and helped with my pain management, their rehabilitation plan also seems to be helping a lot. The team also followed up after my treatment to ensure I was recovering well.</p>
            <p>I would definitely recommend mobile physio to anyone looking for an expert physiotherapist.</p>
