## Design

### Colour Scheme

The website uses mostly white and light grey colours, to create a clean and modern design. The blue colour (`#4EB7DA`) was taken from the blue tape used in the [hero image](#about-page), this creates a theme throughout the project as recurring colours are used.

<summary>Click for Image: Colour Palette</summary>

![Coolors Colour Palette](/assets/images/README/design-colour-palette.png)

</details>

### Typography

The fonts used in the project have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) was used for the Headings on the website.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the favicon.
- [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) was used on all of the remaining text throughout the site.
- Sans-serif was used as a backup font for all of the text, in case the Google Fonts could not be displayed.

### Imagery

#### Hero Image:
The [hero image](#about-page) was used as it shows a physiotherapist working on a client, allowing users to understand the work performed by Mobile Physio. A wide image was used for desktop and larger devices, while a portrait image was picked for usage on mobile devices, both of these images are similar therefore creating a recognisable theme throughout the site.

#### Service Card Images:
The images used for the [service cards](#about-page), were picked as they show a Physio performing the services described below them. They also all feature the hands of the physio, which links them to the [hero image](#about-page). Two out of three of the images also feature a blue colour, which matches the blue of the hero-image tape.

#### Contact Page Images:
The image used in the [contact page](#contact-page) is of a medical reception, this is used as it is located with the contact details of the clinic, linking the image to the content. The image also uses blue colours, linking them to the images used throughout the site.

The clinic information card provides the user with the necessary details to visit Mobile Physio such as address and opening hours. It uses widely recognised [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons to highlight the use meaning of the text.

The form card allows the user to input the necessary details to book an appointment. Most of the inputs are required to submit the form (except for additional info and date of birth), this stops the user from trying to book an appointment, without the necessary information.

<details>
<summary>Click for Image: Contact Page Form - Required Fields</summary>

![Contact page form showing required fields](/assets/images/README/contact-required.png)

</details>  

The form card also has a submit and reset button that enlarges on hover. When the submit button is pressed and the required fields are filled, the user is sent to the [Form Submit](#form-submit-page) page, when the reset button is pressed, the form is cleared.

<details>
<summary>Click for Image: Contact Page Form - Hover</summary>

![Contact page form with buttons enlarged on hover](/assets/images/README/contact-hover.png)

</details>  

The additional info text box is resizable vertically, to allow users to type more info if they require it. The reason that re-sizing the box horizontally is not allowed, is because it would bring the text off of the screen, which would look unprofessional.
